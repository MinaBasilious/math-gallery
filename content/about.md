I'm Mina. I'm a student of pure mathematics and an artist who expresses mathematical structures through visual means. My work lies somewhere between rigorous thinking and creative expression. I find my ideas in combinatorics, number patterns (I have done some research on Fibonacci and related visual proofs), and geometric shapes that appear in analysis and algebra. I find pleasure in expressing a theorem, recursion, or matrix as a composition that emphasizes symmetry, tension, and surprise.
